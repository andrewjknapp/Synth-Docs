# Synthe-Pi-zer

> CS 220 2021 Final Project by Andrew Knapp

## Project Statement
The goal of this project is to create anything with a Raspberry Pi

My project focused on creating a mono synthesizer that can produce controllable, discrete musical tones.

## Steps
1) Generate a sound using Python
2) Create list of frequencies belonging to the C Major scale
3) Correlate input from the potentiometer with one of the defined frequencies
4) Define other waveforms (Sine, Square, Sawtooth, Triangle)
5) Use button to switch between waveforms
