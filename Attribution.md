- The code for defining the Sine, Square, Triangle, and Sawtooth waves as well as the Oscillator and wave adder were taken from [18alantom](https://github.com/18alantom/synth)'s repository in which they are attempting to create a synthesizer with Python. Here is a link to an [article the wrote documenting the process](https://python.plainenglish.io/making-a-synth-with-python-oscillators-2cb8e68e9c3b). 
I used other bits of [18alantom](https://github.com/18alantom/synth)'s controller file as inspiration for my main.py. 
- Also in main.py I used the Freenove Ultimate Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi Tutorials (Chapters 7 and 8) for using a Potentiometer with the Raspberry Pi.
